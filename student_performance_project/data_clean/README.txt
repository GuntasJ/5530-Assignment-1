The data did not contain any null values. 

Binary encoding was applied for lunch and test preparation course, however, this resulted in the chart axes displaying 1 and 0 instead of the names. As such, I kept the binary encoding in a seperate data frame so the visuals were not altered. 

In addition, one-hot encoding was used for many of the features, however, this too was also in a seperate cleaned dataframe so that the graphs displayed with the correct visual data. This was done for the following:
  Lunch
  Race/ethnicity
  Parental education

In addition, since race/ethnicity were not used in the analysis, they can be dropped. This was done in a seperate cleaned version.
