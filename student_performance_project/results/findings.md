There exists a small difference between male and female scores. The differnce favors males in math scores, and it favors femals in reading scores. There exists outliers for female and male students, however, there seems to be a wider distribution of female outliers. It should be noted that the median for each of the genders is particularly close in math, with a somewhat larger difference in reading.

There is an impact on the status of the test preparation on the math scores. Students that completed the test preparation achieved a higher median score than the ones that did not. In addition, there were most student outliers in the no test preparation category near the bottom. This indicates that, for some students, they struggled without the test preparation. We do not see this quite as strongly in the completed section. This could also indicate that completing test preparation gives a higher base-line for students.

The lunch type by students relates to the outcome of test scores. Standard lunch students achieve a higher score when compared to students on free/reduced lunch. The difference between the students is almost 10 points. It is unlikely that the lunch itself is providing this difference. Rather, it is more likely that this indicates the socioeconomic status of the students. It should be noted that the average score for standard students is quite low. We would expect the score to be closer to 75.

The three subjects track near to one another. Reading and writing are closer than Math. This is to be expected as reading and writing are related subjects. The greatest difference was between math and writing, followed by math and reading. However, it should be noted that the difference was still only around 0.2, and it was still closely related.

The math and reading scores are strongly associated together. As the math scores increase, so too do the reading scores. Their relationship almost has a slope of 1. Students that have done test preparation do not have a different slope then the ones that do not. This indicates that the test preparation helps the student's math and reading skills equally.
